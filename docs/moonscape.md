24. Assumption of Risk
In addition to the risks stated below, you accept and acknowledge:

Smart Contract Risk: The HCS-10 protocol and other smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of Points or other unexpected behavior.
Regulatory Risk: The regulatory environment for blockchain technology, digital assets, and reward programs is evolving and uncertain. Future regulations may adversely affect our ability to provide the Service or the Points program.
Wallet Risks: Loss of wallet access, compromised wallet security, or wallet provider failures may result in permanent loss of access to features of our Service.
Points Program Risk: The Points program is experimental and subject to change or termination without compensation.
You accept and acknowledge:

Points have no monetary value and cannot be sold, transferred, or exchanged for money or other assets. You acknowledge that Points are solely for engagement rewards and may be modified or eliminated at any time.
A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of Points and blockchain-based services.
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, digital assets, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of Points and blockchain features.
You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. MoonScape Labs Inc is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that apply to your blockchain activities or Points.
There are risks associated with blockchain interactions and smart contract operations, including but not limited to, the risk of transaction failures, smart contracts with bugs, and data that may become inaccessible. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to interact with blockchain protocols or use our Services.
We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and MoonScape Labs Inc has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain-based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that MoonScape Labs Inc will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.
The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors lose market share or fall out of favor or are unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
MoonScape Labs Inc reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on MoonScape Labs Inc. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on MoonScape Labs Inc or an inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against MoonScape Labs Inc.
If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.

ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICE, PRODUCTS OR THIRD-PARTY SITES, AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MoonScape Labs Inc ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE, CONTENT, POINTS, OR ANY MoonScape Labs Inc PRODUCTS OR SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY MoonScape Labs Inc FOR ITS SERVICE DIRECTLY RELATING TO THE ITEMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.
